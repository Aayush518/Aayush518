**Frontend Engineer | NLP Researcher (Nepali/Myanmar) | Pragmatic Project Lead**  

After more than a decade of exploring programming, design, and teaching—from QBasic at 10 to Java on Nokia devices, Photoshop to LaTeX—I’ve honed in on **three pillars**:  

### 1. **Modern Frontend Engineering**  
   - Building sleek, performant UIs with `Svelte`/`React`, `TypeScript`, and `Canvas`.  
   - Obsessed with: Micro-interactions, edge rendering, and designs that work *offline-first*.  

### 2. **NLP for Under-Resourced Languages**  
   - Focused on **Nepali & Myanmar (Burmese)**:  
     - Speech tech (ASR/TTS) for non-Latin scripts.  
     - Hybrid pipelines (rule-based + ML) to bypass data scarcity.  
   - *Rejects* “LLMs for everything” — prioritizes lightweight, field-deployable tools.  

### 3. **Project Leadership**  
   - **Mentor turned strategist**: Filter ideas ruthlessly. Only greenlight projects that:  
     - Solve *actual* problems (e.g., rural educators, linguists).  
     - Are maintainable with small teams.  
   - Shelved 10+ “cool but unsustainable” prototypes in 2023 alone.

### **Why This Trio?**  
- **Frontend**: Born from hand-coding HTML/CSS on paper and years of design-tool mastery.  
- **NLP**: Rooted in teaching logic, linguistic curiosity, and a drive to democratize tech.  
- **Leadership**: Sharpened by mentoring 200+ students — elder peers included — and shipping tools people *use*.

### **Technical Toolkit**  
`Svelte` `React` `TypeScript` `Python` `Kaldi` `Praat` `Figma` `Git` `Vite`

### **Work Ethos**  
- **“Exploration → Focus”**: Tried everything; now doubling down on *what matters*.  
- **“No Band-Aid Solutions”**: If it can’t survive a 2 AM outage, don’t build it.  
- **“Teach to Learn”**: Still run coding workshops — forces clarity in chaos.
